# URFD-Dataset
Dataset for Slender Urban Road Facility Extraction in Oblique Aerial Images.


### 1. Introduction
We construct URFD dataset for slender urban road facility extraction in Oblique aerial images. Specifically, we first use the Shuangyu data collection platform carried on a DJI M600 UAV to collect oblique aerial images with a size of $7952\times5304$ pixels. Then, we crop them into a size of $512\times512$ pixels and select 1075 images containing urban road facilities with different types and shooting angles. At last, we manually annotated the bounding box and binary mask of targets using Labelme, a graphical image annotation tool.


In general, URFD is a complement of the real-world oblique aerial imagery dataset and consists of $1075$ oblique aerial imagery with a grand sample distance of 2-6 cm and an image size of $512\times512$ pixels. URFD has a more refined classification containing eight categories, including four types of street lamps, two types of monitors, and two types of traffic lights.

Examples of URFD are shown as the figure below.
