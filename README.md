# URFD-Dataset
Dataset for Slender Urban Road Facility Extraction in Oblique Aerial Images.

We construct URFD dataset for slender urban road facility extraction in oOblique aerial images. Specifically, we first use the Shuangyu data collection platform carried on a DJI M600 UAV to collect oblique aerial images with a size of 7952*5304$ pixels. Then, we crop them into a size of 512*512 pixels and select 1075 images containing urban road facilities with different types and shooting angles. At last, we manually annotated the bounding box and binary mask of targets using Labelme, a graphical image annotation tool.


In general, URFD is a complement of the real-world oblique aerial imagery dataset and consists of 1075 oblique aerial imagery with a grand sample distance of 2-6 cm and an image size of 512*512 pixels. Compared with VALID, URFD has a more refined classification containing eight categories, including four types of street lamps, two types of monitors, and two types of traffic lights.

Examples of URFD are shown as the figure below.
